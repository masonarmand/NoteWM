# NoteWM

Simple X11 floating reparenting window manager.
This project is currently a work in progress and is not intended to be used as a replacement
for your current window manager.

## Todo
- Implement more support for Extended Window Manager Hints.
- Fix bug where invalid empty window frames randomly appear sometimes.
- Implement support for XDND
  - https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/XDND/
- Finish creating custom bar application and custom application launcher. (These will have their own GitHub repositories).
